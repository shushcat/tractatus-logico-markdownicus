## Tractatus Logico-Org

![tractatus](http://harryrschwartz.com/assets/images/posts/tractatus.png "tractatus")

If you've ever thought to yourself, "Golly, I'd sure love to read one of the seminal works of 20th-century analytical philosophy, but I'd have to leave my beloved Emacs!" then you've sure stumbled onto the right repo.

Wittgenstein's [*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus) is organized as an outline, which makes it very suitable for transcription into org-mode. This particular version features:

- The original Ogden translation.
- Formulas in LaTeX.
- Truth tables as standard org-mode tables.

### Caveats:

- The *Tractatus* has been displayed as a [tree structure](http://www.tractatuslogico-philosophicus.com/) before, so this isn't a completely original concept. To my knowledge, however, it hasn't been done in org-mode before.
- A few passages in the *Tractatus* make use of illustrations; these aren't currently included. =(

An org-mode-friendly version of *Principia Mathematica* is left as an exercise to the reader.
