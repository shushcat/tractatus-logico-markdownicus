# Tractatus Logico-Markdownicus

Wittgenstein's [*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus) is organized as an outline so the ability to collapse and expand sections really helps with figuring out what's going on.

This is the Ogden translation, with formulas typeset in LaTeX and images from the Project Gutenberg version of this text.

Aside from being in Markdown as opposed to Org Mode syntax, this differs from [upstream](https://github.com/hrs/tractatus-logico-org) in that it includes images and a makefile to allow easy generation of a PDF if, for some reason, you don't want to get the nicer-looking version from Project Gutenberg.

- The *Tractatus* [at Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5740) is the source for the images in this version, and is also very nicely typseset indeed.
